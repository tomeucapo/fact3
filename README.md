# Fact 3 

A very old DOS based application for invoicing, inventory, customers management, ...
Developed with latest version of Professional System Development BASIC 7.1.

This a my first big project developed since 1995 until 1999 and used in production environment with Novell Server or Windows Server and shared files, supporting user concurrency based on SHARED file old techniques that can lock specified record of sequential file.

The main data storage used in this project are sequential binary files and selfmade indexed files to search items into tables. Have a one file per table and another for index.

Main source code located into fonts directory. Also there are precompiled EXE binaries into this repository.
